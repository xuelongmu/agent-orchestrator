// Package sessionguard owns the one invariant every write into a live
// session's pane must satisfy: re-read the session immediately before writing
// and refuse when the paste could land somewhere only the user may act. The
// runtime appends Enter after every paste, so a write into a session paused on
// a permission/approval dialog would answer the decision on the user's behalf
// — an unrecoverable action, unlike a skipped message which callers re-attempt
// or surface. Every pane-writing path (user sends, post-send Enter nudges,
// lifecycle reaction nudges) funnels through this guard so the stale-state
// check lives in one tested place instead of being re-derived per call-site.
