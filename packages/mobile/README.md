# Agent Orchestrator — Mobile

Expo (expo-router) mobile supervisor for Agent Orchestrator. Four tabs — Kanban, PRs,
Orchestrator, Settings — plus a spawn flow, a session screen with a live terminal, and a
preview browser. It is a **thin client**: it talks to the AO daemon running on your
computer over your local network (or Tailscale). It never runs agents itself.

> **Development builds only — Expo Go is not supported.** The app depends on native modules,
> so it must be compiled onto the device (`npx expo run:ios|run:android`). Expo Go can't load
> it; don't file bugs from it.

## How the phone reaches your machine

The daemon's primary listener is loopback-only (`127.0.0.1:3001`) and unauthenticated — a
phone can never reach it. To let a phone in, the desktop app opens a **second, opt-in LAN
listener** (default port **3011**) bound to `0.0.0.0`, protected by a rotating bearer
password, serving only the app API. It exists only while **Connect Mobile** is switched on
in the desktop app; switching it off closes the socket.

```
phone ──HTTP/WS── 0.0.0.0:3011   (LAN listener, bearer password, opt-in)
                       │
                 same daemon process
                       │
desktop/CLI ───── 127.0.0.1:3001 (loopback, no auth, unchanged)
```

Transport is **plaintext HTTP by design** — this is a trusted-home-network tool. On
untrusted Wi-Fi, use Tailscale instead and point the app at the `100.x` address or MagicDNS
name. Background: [`docs/adr/0001-lan-listener-for-mobile.md`](../../docs/adr/0001-lan-listener-for-mobile.md).

## Prerequisites

| For             | You need                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Everything      | Node 20+, and AO running on your machine (desktop app, or the daemon from source)     |
| Phone ↔ machine | Same Wi-Fi network, or both on the same Tailnet                                       |
| iOS build       | macOS, Xcode 16+, an Apple ID (a free one gives a 7-day signing profile), a USB cable |
| Android build   | Android Studio (SDK + platform-tools for `adb`), a USB cable                          |

## Install

This package is **not** part of an npm workspace — install from inside it:

```bash
cd packages/mobile
npm install       # .npmrc sets legacy-peer-deps; postinstall runs patch-package
```

Two rules worth knowing before you fight an install:

- **Do not run `npm install --force` here.** It hoists SDK-incompatible transitive Expo deps
  and the app crashes on launch. Plain `npm install` in this directory is correct.
- `metro.config.js` pins `react` and `react-native` to this package's copies. Don't remove
  that — two React instances kill the app at startup with _"main has not been registered"_.

## Step 1 — Turn on Connect Mobile on the desktop

Nothing on the phone works until the desktop opens the LAN bridge. Do this first.

**1. Start the desktop app.** Either launch the packaged AO app, or run it from source
(it starts its own daemon):

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev      # Electron supervisor + daemon
```

**2. Open the pairing modal:** in the desktop app, **Sidebar → Settings menu → Connect Mobile**.

**3. Flip the "Enable mobile" toggle on.** The bridge binds immediately and the modal reveals
the pairing details:

- a **QR code** (encodes `{v:1, host, port, password}`),
- the plaintext **host:port**, e.g. `192.168.1.84:3011`,
- the 8-character **connection password** (copyable),
- **Regenerate password**, which rotates the secret and drops any connected phone.

Leave the modal open — you scan that QR in step 3. Toggling **off** tears the bridge down,
so the phone goes offline until you turn it back on.

**Headless (daemon only, no Electron UI)?** Start the daemon and drive the same routes over
loopback:

```bash
cd backend && go run ./cmd/ao start

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/mobile/enable
curl -s      http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/mobile/status    # → {enabled, host, port, password}
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/mobile/disable
```

Type the `host`/`port`/`password` from `status` into the app's Settings by hand (step 3).

## Step 2 — Build and install the dev build

You compile the app onto the device once; after that, JS changes hot-reload from Metro and
you only rebuild when native config changes. `ios/` and `android/` are **generated and
gitignored** — the run commands prebuild them for you.

### On a cabled device (the main path)

**iOS, over the cable:**

1. Plug the iPhone in and tap **Trust This Computer**.
2. On the phone: **Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → On** (the phone reboots).
3. Build and install:

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device      # pick your iPhone from the list
   ```

   If Xcode rejects the bundle identifier or team, open `ios/AO.xcworkspace`, select the
   **AO** target → **Signing & Capabilities**, choose your personal team and let Xcode manage
   signing, then re-run the command.

4. On first launch iOS asks for **Local Network** access. Allow it, or the app cannot reach
   the daemon on your LAN.

**Android, over the cable:**

1. On the phone, enable **Developer options** (tap Build number 7×), then **USB debugging**.
2. Plug in, accept the RSA fingerprint prompt, and confirm the device is visible:

   ```bash
   adb devices      # must list your device as "device", not "unauthorized"
   ```

3. Build and install:

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android --device
   ```

4. Let the phone reach Metro through the cable:

   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
   ```

   Optional if the phone is on the same Wi-Fi, but it makes JS reloads immune to flaky Wi-Fi.
   It does **not** cover the daemon connection — that still goes over Wi-Fi (or Tailscale) to
   `host:3011`.

Cleartext HTTP to the bridge already works on both platforms: Android through
`usesCleartextTraffic` in `app.json`, iOS through `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` in the prebuilt
`Info.plist`.

> **On `expo-dev-client`:** this package doesn't depend on it today, so the debug build
> connects straight to Metro and has no in-app launcher or URL switcher. If you want the
> launcher UI (scan a Metro QR from inside the app, switch bundler URLs), run
> `npx expo install expo-dev-client`, rebuild with `npx expo run:*`, and serve with
> `npx expo start --dev-client`.

### On a simulator / emulator

Same build commands without `--device`. The daemon host differs — a simulator isn't "on your
Wi-Fi" the way a phone is:

```bash
npx expo run:ios         # iOS Simulator    → daemon host 127.0.0.1
npx expo run:android     # Android emulator → daemon host 10.0.2.2
```

Port is `3011` either way. The pairing QR encodes your LAN IP, which usually works here too;
if it doesn't, type the host above by hand (step 3).

## Step 3 — Pair the phone

In the app: **Settings → scan the pairing QR** (grant camera access when asked). One scan
writes host, port, and password, then reconnects — no typing.

Manual entry, if you prefer (or for simulators / Tailscale):

| Field             | Value                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Host**          | Your machine's LAN IP (`ipconfig getifaddr en0` on macOS), or Tailscale name/`100.x` |
| **API Port**      | `3011` — the Connect Mobile bridge, **not** the loopback `3001`                      |
| **Password**      | The 8-character password from the Connect Mobile modal                               |
| **Terminal Port** | Legacy, ignored. The daemon serves REST and the `/mux` terminal on the API port      |
| **Use TLS**       | Off for the LAN bridge. On only for real HTTPS, e.g. a Tailscale funnel              |

Tap **Test connection**, then **Save**. The password lives in the device keystore (iOS
Keychain / Android Keystore), never in AsyncStorage.

## Everyday dev loop

With the dev build installed on the device, JS changes need no rebuild — just start Metro
and launch the app from the home screen:

```bash
npm start        # Metro; save a file and the phone hot-reloads
```

Rebuild with `npx expo run:ios|run:android` only when **native** config changes: `app.json`
plugins or permissions, native dependencies, `expo-build-properties`. After dependency
surgery, regenerate the native projects from scratch with `npx expo prebuild --clean`.

## Troubleshooting

| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Crash at launch, _"main has not been registered"_ | Two React copies. Keep `metro.config.js` intact, reinstall with plain `npm install` (never `--force`), then `npx expo prebuild --clean`.                     |
| **Test connection** fails, everything times out   | Connect Mobile is off on the desktop, wrong port (`3011`, not `3001`), phone on a different network, or the macOS firewall is blocking incoming connections. |
| 401 / invalid password                            | The password was regenerated on the desktop. Re-scan the QR.                                                                                                 |
| Locked out after repeated failures                | The bridge locks out a source after 5 failed attempts. Wait it out, or toggle Connect Mobile off and on.                                                     |
| `adb devices` shows `unauthorized`                | Re-accept the USB debugging prompt on the phone.                                                                                                             |
| iOS app installs, then closes immediately         | Untrusted developer profile: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → trust your Apple ID**.                                                         |
| App runs but can't reach the daemon (iOS)         | The Local Network prompt was denied: **Settings → Privacy & Security → Local Network → AO** → on.                                                            |
| Phone can't reach Metro                           | `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` (Android), or `npx expo start --tunnel` (either platform).                                                                   |
| Terminal renders blank                            | The xterm WebView is patched via `patch-package`; confirm `postinstall` ran (`npx patch-package`).                                                           |
